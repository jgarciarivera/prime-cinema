# prime-cinema
An Android app that displays top rated movies according to user selected genre and release year. Uses Retrofit and Gson libraries to make API calls and deserialize returned JSON objects.

This project is meant to serve as a personal introduction to the Activity Lifecycle, Fragments, Intents, RecyclerViews, and other Android development topics.

To-Do:
- Fragments providing movie details upon click/ tap
- Remove cards with null response from OMDB call
- Refine search results from TMDB 
- Spinners to select genre and year (replace temporary randomized genres/ years)
- ProgressBar for loading data transition (perhaps using RxJava library)
