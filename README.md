# prime-cinema
An Android app that displays top rated movies according to user selected genre and release year. Uses Retrofit and Gson libraries to make API calls and deserialize returned JSON objects.

This project is meant to serve as a personal introduction to RecyclerViews, CardViews, Fragments, and other Android development concepts.

To-do:
- Add Picasso or Glide library to display posters
- Format cards for even height
- Refine API call results (sort by rating, vote count over 20)
