# prime-cinema
An Android app that displays top rated movies according to user selected genre and release year. Uses Retrofit and Gson libraries to make API calls and deserialize returned JSON objects.

This project is meant to serve as a personal introduction to the Activity Lifecycle, Fragments, Intents, RecyclerViews, and other Android development topics.

To-Do:
- Exception handling for network requests
- Spinners to select genre and year (replace temporary randomized genres/ years)
- ProgressBar for loading data transition (perhaps using RxJava library)
- Improve UI (color theme, formatting, font size, etc.)
- Review and address warnings
